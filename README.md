# terrible-handwriting
I do have terrible handwriting.

The purpose of this little project is for me to discover and use pytorch in a basic manner.
I plan on training a NN on images containing a single, lowercase letter I've written.

Then, I'll test it on some new letters I'll write, and hopefully it will be able to properly tell the difference between how I write my "o"s , "e"s and "a"s, or my "u"s and "v"s... or my "b"s and "f"s... etc

IDK I just wanna mess around a bit with new stuff
we'll see
